## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Anna Kuehnast!
I've always felt deeply.
I'm a passionate writer, avid reader, and lover of forests. I have an insatiable desire to grow and learn personally and professionally, excited to learn all I can. 
I have fought to retain my love for others and wonder at the world around me, seeking to use storytelling to help others communicate.
My current learning obsessions include tech writing, aviation/aerospace writing, and anthropology.

Skills
Strong organizational and time-management skills.
Rigorous Work Ethic.
Developed social media schedule for college project, including writing 8 Facebook posts and 5 LinkedIn posts.
Wrote a flyer, annual report, internal newsletter, and an Op-ed for the PR SNHU class
Has created multiple websites on different CMS Platforms, including GoDaddy, Wix, and WordPress.

Continually fascinated by the weightier things of this world, I love learning about sociology. My journey of personal growth has most recently included discovering how my brain and body function as a neurdivergent young adult. When not petting cats, you can find me enjoying video games, watching animated films, and nerding out over sociology. 
Fun facts about me: I play violin and cello, listen to metal, pop, and folk in equal measure, and love walking in the woods.
