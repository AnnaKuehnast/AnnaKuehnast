## :evergreen_tree:Anna Kuehnast - Technical and Content Writing Portfolio 
 
An ambitious communications student with CMS experience, excited to continue learning in an entry-level content or technical writer position.   

### About Me
I'm a passionate writer, avid reader, and lover of forests. I have an insatiable desire to grow and learn personally and professionally, excited to learn all I can.  
I have fought to retain my love for others and wonder at the world around me, seeking to use storytelling to help others communicate.  
My current fascinations include tech writing, aviation/aerospace writing, and anthropology.  

When not petting cats, you can find me practicing cello, listening to metal, pop, and folk in equal measure, or walking in the woods.
